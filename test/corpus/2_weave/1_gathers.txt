"What's that?" my master asked.
	*	"I am somewhat tired[."]," I repeated.
		"Really," he responded. "How deleterious."
	*	"Nothing, Monsieur!"[] I replied.
		"Very good, then."
	*  "I said, this journey is appalling[."] and I want no more of it."
	"Ah," he replied, not unkindly. "I see you are feeling frustrated. Tomorrow, things will improve."

- With that Monsieur Fogg left the room.

- 	The road could not be much further! Mackie would have the engine running, and then I'd be safe.

	*	I reached the road and looked about[]. And would you believe it?
	* 	I should interrupt to say Mackie is normally very reliable[]. He's never once let me down. Or rather, never once, previously to that night.

-	The road was empty. Mackie was nowhere to be seen.
