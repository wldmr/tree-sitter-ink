# Support files for different text editors

This will mostly be queries, but can include other config files that are needed to use the syntax.

Collecting non-query files in here is admittedly a bit dirty, but by doing it that way:

1. the query files are automatically tested, and
2. the editor config is not scattered around disparate directories. Ideally, you should be able to just drop/link
   the directory into the appropriate location and be good to go.
